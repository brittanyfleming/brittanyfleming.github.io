<h3>Quotes on Language</h3>

<blockquote>
  "Because the process of knowing is inseparable from

  student inquiry."

  are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation
  and use of words involves a process of free creation."
  &mdash; <a href =
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>
</blockquote>
    
    
<blockquote>
  "Journalists say that when a dog bites a man, that is not news,
  but when a man bites a adog that is news.  This is the essence of
  the langauge instinct: language conveys news."  &mdash;
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker">Steven Pinker</a>
</blockquote>    

<blockquote>
